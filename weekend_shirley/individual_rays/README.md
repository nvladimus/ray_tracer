This is a naive translation or ray tracer in the book of [P. Shirley, Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) from C++ to Python.

It starts and stops at Chapter 5, because it runs too slow.

For a fast numpy implementation, see `../numpy_rays` folder and links therein.

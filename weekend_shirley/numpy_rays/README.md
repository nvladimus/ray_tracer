This is numpy version or ray tracer in the book of 
[P. Shirley, Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) 
translated from C++ to Python. The numpy implementation is done following these [examples](https://github.com/jspjut/shirley_rt_python).

The Vec3() class here contains numpy array of rays, rather than single vector. 
All operations are done on arrays of vectors.

For a slower, pure python implementation, where Vec3() is individual vector,
 see `../naive` folder.
